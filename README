This is my sopwith source as of 4/11/2001. There is more information in 
other files:

FAQ - Frequently asked questions about SDL Sopwith
ChangeLog - Whats new
TODO - a sneak peek at possible future features

All my modifications to the sopwith source are dual-licensed under the
sopwith license - that is, you may consider them to be under the sopwith
license and treat them accordingly, but you may also use them in your
own GPL'ed programs if you want. Note that this only applies to those
portions of the source that I myself have wrote - the majority of the
source is under the more restrictive Sopwith License.

doc/GPL - GNU GPL
doc/license.txt - The Sopwith License

If you like SDL Sopwith, email me and let me know!
