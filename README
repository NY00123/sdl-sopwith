This is my modified sopwith source, as of 15/10/2001. I have removed all
the x86 asm (rewritten/replaced with portable C code). Internally, it 
draws everything in CGA, and this is then converted and drawn to the
screen. The PC speaker is emulated in a similar way. 

Currently this is only known to work in linux, but it is fairly portable
code and should compile on any system.  It requires LibSDL for video
and sound, this is available from www.libsdl.org. I have only tried
compiling with GCC, possibly it would work with MSVC but I have no idea.
