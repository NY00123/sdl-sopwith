To Do:

Code Cleanup: 
	half the files have extern definitions to access functions
	and global variables in other files. These should be put in
	headers.
	There are a lot of ifdefs left over to check for the
	architecture, these are redundant now and should be removed.
	Similarly there are function calls to control DOS interrupts
	which also should be removed.
DOS Port? probably wouldnt be too hard infact
TCP/IP networking: probably not that hard
Greater control over game options: eg the guided missiles of sopwith
	network edition, display splatted birds etc
Hi score table?
