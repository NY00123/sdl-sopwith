v1.10 (2x/10/2001)

Networking! I have hacked in TCP/IP Networking based on the old asyncronous
multiplayer option code. There is a new option on the main menu "Network"
through which network games can be started.
Fixed use of auxdisp which was why the score was not displayed and was 
also why the map was not being properly refreshed.
Fixed command line args and updated help screen
Title screen based on the "network edition" title screen.
Extra command line args: 
-f (fullscreen)
-2 (double size window for easier viewing)
-l (network mode, listen for connection)
-j (network mode, connect to host)
Sopwith now quits if you hit ctrl-c, not escape, like in the original.
However, for lazy people not wanting to wait while their plane crashes
and the game exits, if you hit ctrl-c 3 times it quits immediately.
Hitting escape in menus now takes you back to the previous menu.

Major code cleanup - this is the main difference. I have created headers
for all the source modules so that it is no longer neccesary to include
millions of "extern" definitions in every file (which is tedious, ugly
and prone to bugs). I have also reformatted all the code so that it looks
nicer, and removed some obfuscations so that the code is more readable
in places. 
CVS Tags have been added to all source files for if/when I put this into
CVS.
Various extra code hacks: sopwith1 theme music (was different music in
sopwith 1, I extracted the music sequence from the hexdump),
solid ground (also ala sopwith1)

v1.00 (15/10/2001)

Video and Sound is all working (afaik)
ASM removed/replaced.
Internally it draws everything as if it were still using a CGA screen,
I have written some SDL code that "emulates" a CGA screen and draws
it to an SDL screen. 
Sound is done in a similar way: The digital output in LibSDL is used to
make the appropriately-pitched beepings to sound like a PC Speaker :)
The API to the PC Speaker code is identical to those of a small 
library I wrote a while back to control the PC Speaker in DJGPP, this
is incase I want to do a DOS port.
Moved all of Andrew Jenners decompiled code into amj/, I do not use this
directly but it is useful in deciphering some ASM functions.
attic/ has all the asm source and other source files that are redundant
now.
doc/ has all the documentation that came with the source
current bugs: crashing into an ox doesnt turn your screen pink,
	map/status bar dont refresh properly (?? score not displayed)
